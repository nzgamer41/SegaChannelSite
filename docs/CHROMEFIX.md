## So what the hell is chromefix.html?
Basically, due to Google's new policies around autoplaying media elements [(which can be found here)](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes), in order to actually support all the videos and audio that I have set up on the website, it requires a bit of cheeky code in order to run nice on Chrome.

What chromefix.html contains is a image element of a play button that once clicked loads up an iframe, which since the user has interacted with the page to click it, is allowed to autoplay its videos and audio, since passing permissions down for autoplay is one of the 3 ways you can autoplay an element now on Chrome, the other two are interacting with the page before the element starts (which is what the button does), or it meets a bunch of confusing requirements that essentially boil down to "the user has been here before". The only other way to enable autoplay is if a mobile user has added the page to their home screen, which is fucking stupid and honestly Google should've thought of a better way to stop those spammy ads they're trying to block rather then cool shit that relies on native HTML5, JS and CSS *cough cough*
